## Overview

Our code is designed to control our robot for various tasks and challenges in the FTC competition. It includes a limelight auto (WIP) and teleop modes, along with custom algorithms and strategies to maximize our robot's performance.

## Features

- **Autonomous Mode:** We made an auto for each battery voltage so we are accurate every time; it scores 48 points accurately every time.

- **TeleOp Mode:** Manual control for drivers to operate the robot, still a work in progress, but it's pretty efficient.
