# FTC Team 26530 Atomic Aces

Welcome to the official repository for FTC Team 26530 Atomic Aces!

## Introduction

This repository contains the code developed by our team for the FIRST Tech Challenge. The code is primarily written and maintained by Owen Rossing, with valuable contributions from Andy G. and other mentors.

## Team Members

- **Owen R.** - Lead Developer, backup drivetrain driver, build team
- **Ben A.** - Main drivetrain driver, head of build team
- **Merek H.** - Lead CAD designer, main arm driver, build team
- **Izzy Sc.** - backup arm driver, portfolio team, keeps the team on track

## Overview

Our code is designed to control our robot for various tasks and challenges in the FTC competition. It includes a limelight auto (WIP) and teleop modes, along with custom algorithms and strategies to maximize our robot's performance.

## Features

- **Autonomous Mode**: Work in progress, will use limelight combined with an omnidirectional intake to hopefully score a 32 point auto.
- **TeleOp Mode**: Manual control for drivers to operate the robot, still work in progress.
- **Custom Algorithms**: Advanced algorithms for navigation, object detection, and more (limelight).
